2020-04-24 V0.0.3 - Bug fix for array encoding negative numbers with positive radix.
                    Clean up and rewrite major portions of the Docs. 
                    Add testing for imaginary base numbers.
                    Add testing for array and hash encoded numbers. 
                    Add underscore capability for numeric strings.
                    Add tests for numeric strings containing underscore.

2020-04-24 V0.0.4 - Bug fix for array/hash encoding zero values incorrectly.
                    Add tests for zero encoding.
                    Made positive and negative encoding testing a little more forgiving of imprecision.
                      Was getting sporatic failures in least significant digits of converted Rats.

2020-04-25 V0.0.5 - Made from-base() ignore case in bases -2 <-> -36 (similar to positive bases).
                    Added tests for ignore case in bases -2 <-> -36.
                    Trapped errors when trying to from-base() with out-of-range characters.
                    Test for out-of-range characters.
                    Detect and test for too many dec\b\b\bradicimal points.
                    Expanded glyph set a bit (actually, realized that I had miscounted while... ⬋⬋⬋)
                    Added testing for out-of-range and threshold sized positive/negative radicies.
